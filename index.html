            <p>I am Anna, an IT Systems officer with an affinity for process improvement and automation, an apartment slowly being taken over by pot plants, and a love for communication in all its forms, (especially romance novels).
                <br>
                <br>
            I thrive in a frequently changing environment with something new to learn every day and possess a keen interest in workplace morale and culture. I take pride in using my innate ability to “distract others”, to quickly create lasting relationships and rapport that allows me to crowd source ideas and creatively make an overall happier, more effective workplace.
            <br>
            <br>
            After recently enrolling in She Codes, I have been given the opportunity to further my love of falling down the rabbit hole of automation by working on a myriad of projects using HTML, CSS, Python, React and Django.</p>
